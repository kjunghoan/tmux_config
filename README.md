## Notes

- Currently, there seems to be a problem with vim-tmux-navigator in my settings which causes neovim to not recognize my leader key ('<Space>')
    - I might put this back in when this issue gets resolved but I have to Rollback the VM to test so for the time being that does not seem likely
